	<title>Log collection improvement</title>
	<shortdesc>Log collection improvement feature is used to avoid MME instability or performance
		issue caused by the large amount of logs when the enabled log level is not the default one
		in load scenarios.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The log collection improvement feature provides two mechanism through which the log
			output can be under control while enough logging information is provided to troubleshoot
			various scenarios:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The log level can be defined per class, instead of the whole process. And the
				additional filters based on subscriber IDs can be added. For example: operator can
				change the log level to trace level for the whole paging procedure classes for a
				specific IMSI.</li>
			<li>The log collection improvement feature can be automatically disabled in case the
				source consumption reaches a certain limit. This limit is configured in the
				LNX924NX.INI and LNX934NX.INI files.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The log collection improvement feature only supports paging and service request
			procedures.</p>
