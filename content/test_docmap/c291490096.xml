The input parameters include the PLMN and the radio access type.        The output is the PLMN, the RAT type and the IMSIs. This feature is supported for the        2G/3G/4G/5G.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>The new CLI command is created to query the lead IPDS map table to display at most 100            IMSIs matching PLMN (MCC, MNC) entered. The command does a slow walk on the lead IPDS UE            context map. The output displays the list of the IMSIs belonging to the PLMN. The CMM            has CLI to clear the list collected.</p></conbody></concept>
