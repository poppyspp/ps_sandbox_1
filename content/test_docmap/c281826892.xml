The AMF maintains independent registration and signaling connection            states, registration areas, and security contexts for the two access methods. For            untrusted non-3GPP access, the AMF interfaces an N3IWF over the N2 interface. The N3IWF            terminates the IPSec tunnel from the UE over the untrusted non-3GPP access. The 3GPP            access and the non-3GPP access share the same common 5G-GUTI from the AMF when the same            AMF serves the UE for both access methods in the same PLMN. For non-3GPP access, a            single non-3GPP TAI is defined for a PLMN. The AMF registers the UE for non-3GPP access            to the UDM. The UE does not perform periodic registrations over the non-3GPP access, but            the AMF provides the UE a non-3GPP de-registration timer. The AMF runs a non-3GPP            implicit de-registration timer to detach the UE that does not establish a connection            with the network inside the AMF that is running the timer.</p><p>This feature provides initial phase of the feature functionality. It includes SMS            over the NAS service for non-3GPP access. </p><note>            <p>Once the AMF allows SMS allowed for a UE over one access, the UE                considers that the SMS is allowed for both access methods, and the UE registration                is over. The UE is registered over non-3GPP either with the same AMF and PLMN as it                is with the 3GPP access, or non-3GPP access is served by a different AMF under a                different PLMN from the 3GPP access. When a UE is registered with the same AMF over                both access methods, the AMF maintains information on the PDUs which access they are                associated with.</p>        </note><p>This initial phase feature includes the support of the following procedures.</p><section>            <title>Initial registration over non-3GPP</title>            <p>Registration over 3GPP and registration over non-3GPP are supported for a UE on the                same AMF. </p>            <p>Registration over 3GPP and registration over non-3GPP on the same AMF are supported                only on the same PLMN. </p>            <p>Only a UE on the home PLMN is supported for the registration of                non-3GPP access.</p>            <p>Intra-AMF mobility registration over non-3GPP is supported.</p>        </section><section>            <title>Deregistration for non-3GPP access only or for both access                methods</title>            <p>Both UE-initiated and network-initiated (for example, UDM-initiated) de-registration                are supported. When a UE is in ECM-IDLE mode in the non-3GPP access, it only                implicitly de-registers the UE, for example, the de-registration request is not sent                to the UE for non-3GPP access through 3GPP access. This feature supports the purge                of the UE using the <cmdname>cmm subscriber delete</cmdname> command and implicit                de-registration of the UE due to expiration of the non-3GPP access de-registration                timer.</p>        </section><section>            <title>PDU setup and release over non-3GPP access</title>            <p>Only the initial setup of a PDU on the non-3GPP access is supported,                that is, the existing PDU on the non-3GPP access is not supported.</p>            <p>Both the UE-initiated and the network-initiated PDU releases are supported.</p>            <note>                <p>IDLE-connected transitions are not supported.</p>            </note>        </section><section>            <title>SMS over NAS for non-3GPP access</title>            <p>Registration with SMS for the MO/MT SMS delivery over the non-3GPP                access is supported, depending on the setting of the <parmname>smsPreferredAccess</parmname> and <parmname>smsReattemptViaOtherAccess</parmname> parameters.</p>        </section></conbody></concept>
