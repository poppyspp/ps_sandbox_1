Then it resolves the S4 service to            send the Create Session Request message to. This logic is applied as basic Rel-8            functionality.</p><p>The services are obtainable from the response to the NAPTR query in the form of services            which are named as:</p><p>x-3gpp-sgw:x-s4</p><p>x-3gpp-sgw:x-s5-gtp</p><p>x-3gpp-sgw:x-s8-gtp</p><p>Within the answers contained at the S-GW NAPTR response, the SGSN selects those S-GWs            that support:</p><p>both the S4 and S5 or the S4 and S8 (depending on the case) services within the same            NAPTR answer.</p><p>both the S4 and S5 or the S4 and S8 (depending on the case) services in different NAPTR            answers but with the same canonical name.</p><p>A UTPFIL parameter is also introduced in order to keep the old functionality so as to            address temporarily possible compatibility problems. The permanent solution is to update            the DNS service so as to include appropriate S4 service (x-3gpp-sgw:x-s4) at the DNS            responses. The default value of UTPFIL is to deactivate the old functionality. In case            that a valid S-GW cannot be found, the fallback to Rel-7 functionality occurs by            default.</p></conbody></concept>
