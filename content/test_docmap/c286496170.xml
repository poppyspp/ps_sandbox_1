The CPNF subscriber updates subscription or unsubscribes. In            addition, the operator can subscribe for one-time or continuous report.</p><p>The handling of the Namf_EventExposure subscribe, modify, unsubscribe and notify            operations of the new events is the same as the old ones implemented with feature <ph outputclass="featname">AMF support for event exposure for location report and                presence including LADN (Feature f20053-01)</ph>.</p><p>For the registration state report events, the AMF notifies the corresponding registered            consumer(s) when the AMF becomes aware of a registration state change of the UE. This            includes inter-AMF mobility. Registration state (Registered/Deregistered) with access            type is included in the Notify message.</p><p>If the Subscribe Request message contains the immediate flag set, then in the Subscribe            Response message from the AMF, it also contains the current registration state of the            UE.</p><p>For the connectivity state report events, the AMF notifies the corresponding registered            consumer(s) when the AMF becomes aware of a connectivity state change of the UE.

Connectivity state (Idle/Connected) with access type is            included in the Notify message.</p><p>If the Subscribe Request message contains the immediate flag set, then in the Subscribe            Response message from the AMF, it also contains the current connectivity state of the            UE.</p><p>For communication failure report events, the AMF notifies the corresponding registered            consumer(s) when the AMF becomes aware of an RAN or NAS failure event. Corresponding RAN            or NAS release code is included in the Notify message.</p><p>For loss of connectivity events, the AMF notifies the corresponding registered            consumer(s) when the AMF detects that the target UE is no longer reachable for either            signaling nor user plane communication. Such condition is identified when the mobile            reachable timer expires in the AMF, when the UE detaches, and when the AMF deregisters            from the UDM for an active UE.</p><p>If the Subscribe Request message contains the immediate flag set and the UE is already            not reachable for either the signaling or the user plane communication, the AMF reports            the event directly in the Subscribe Response message.</p><note>            <p>Only reporting for a single UE is supported.
