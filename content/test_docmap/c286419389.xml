This is required when the links are activated on the        SCTP/M3UA/SCCP level but the RNCs do not initiate the id-Reset.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>In case of the SGSN's failure or SU, the SGSN is able to detect when the lower            SCCP layer is ready to be used from the RANAP subsystem. When the SCCP local and remote            subsystem is in available state and can route outgoing packets, the SGSN's SCCP layer            sends a notification to the NECC's Iu interface handler for all SCCP signaling points            that use the RANAP subsystem in order to initiate the RANAP reset procedure from the            SGSN side. This functionality is controllable by global parameter <parmname>ranapResetAfterSysRestart</parmname>. The RANAP reset is initiated            only for the RNCs whose state in MariaDB is other than locked or blocked. The state of            these RNCs will then be changed to <option>resetbysgsn</option>.</p><p>In addition to this, the SGSN can initiate the RANAP reset procedure if the            operator switches the RNC state in the NECC's RNC table from                <option>outOfService</option> to <option>unlocked</option>, or from                <option>locked</option> to <option>unlocked</option>. This functionality is enabled            by default.</p></conbody></concept>
