The maximum total number of IRI events that        can be buffered is configurable with the LI CLI.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><ul><li>Up to 2000 IRI event reports can be buffered on the MME/SGSN side of the                CMM.</li><li>Up to 2000 IRI event reports can be buffered on the AMF side of the CMM.</li><li>Up to 4000 IRI event reports can be buffered in case of QA CMM                configuration.</li></ul><p>When there is a communication loss on the X2 link between the CMM and the LIB,            all the IRI events to be transmitted are stored in a buffer. When the X2 link is            restored, all the events stored are sent to the LIB and the operation of the IRI            reporting continues as normal. </p><p>The IRI events are stored and sent out in the order they were received. If the            buffer size limit is reached, the incoming IRI events replace the oldest buffered IRI            messages.</p><p>With this feature, the buffering of the MME/SGSN and/or the AMF for the X2 links            is supported. Buffering of multiple X2 links is also supported.</p></conbody></concept>
