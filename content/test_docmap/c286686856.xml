The        new purge timer provides the ability to extend the purge timer for IoT devices to 30 days (1        - 720 hours).</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>With this feature, the provisioning range for the IoT purge timer is 0 to 720 hours.            There is no change to the existing 4G Purge Timer functionality.</p><p>The IoT purge timer is disabled by default on the MME with value of 0. When the            IoT purge timer feature is disabled, the existing purge timer in the range of 1 to 120            hours will continue to apply for all 4G UEs including IoT devices.</p><p>The IoT purge timer can be enabled on the MME when provisioned with a value            between 1 and 720 hours. When the IoT purge timer feature is enabled, it only applies to            the IoT devices. The 4G purge timer continues to apply for regular mobile broadband            (MBB) devices.</p><p>This feature applies only to 4G IoT devices on the MME.</p><p>If this feature is in use and feature MME support for 320 hours unit in the T3412            extended timer (Feature f10409-02) is configured to the maximum values, the UE context            (VLR) can be kept on the MME for 413 + 30 days (up to 14 months).</p></conbody></concept>
