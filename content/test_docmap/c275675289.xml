The MME supports up to 31 units, allowing        a maximum value of 31*320 hours for the T3412 extended timer negotiated with the PSM and LPA        UE.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>The UEs which support power saving mode (PSM) operation can negotiate an extended            periodic TAU timer with the network.</p><p>This feature supports a larger periodic TAU timer for the power saving mode (PSM)            and the low priority access (LPA). The CMM accepts the 320 hours unit for the timer            specification in local provisioning and in the S6a messaging.</p><p>Prior to this feature, the timer value units for the 320 hours was capped at a            maximum of six to reduce possible testing efforts. With this feature, the upper values            of the extended T3412 timer can be: 320 hours, 640 hours, 960 hours, â€¦ 30*320 hours,            31*320 hours.</p><p>It is not possible to negotiate a periodic timer between the discrete values due to the            message definition in the 3GPP.</p><p>Enhancing T3412 extended timer for <ph outputclass="featname">LAP (low access                priority) devices (Feature m10115-01)</ph> UEs that are not PSM is part of this            feature.</p></conbody></concept>
