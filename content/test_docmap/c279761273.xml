As stated on TS 23.502                                on PDU establishment procedure, step 11 (N1N2 Message Transfer),                                that normally is used by the SMF to provide N1 accept message                                towards the UE with the N2 container to setup radio resources. If                                the PDU session establishment fails anywhere between step 5 (PDU                                Session Create SM context Response) and step 11                                (Namf_Communication_N1N2 Message Transfer), the                                Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request includes the N1 SM                                container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message as defined                                in 3GPP TS 24.501, and does not include any N2 SM container.

In this case, the steps between step 12 (N2 PDU                                Session Request) to step 17 (Namf PDU Session Update SM Context                                Response) are skipped.</p>                            <p>The AMF supports receiving on step 11 of PDU establishment procedure                                for N1N2 Message Transfer request with N1 only (containing the N1                                Reject message).
