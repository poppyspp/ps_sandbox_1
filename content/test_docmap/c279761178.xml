With this feature, operators can provide Décor        service without HSS functionality.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>When this feature is activated and the UE matches an IMSI range with a valid UUT,            the provisioned UUT is used for dedicated core network services. Otherwise, if the HSS            includes the UUT in S6a functionality, the CMM uses UUT based on subscription data. When            the UUT is added to or removed from an IMSI range record, the update can take effect at            the next UE reattach or TAU or service request. All external messages, S11, S10 and N26,            include the subscribed UUT regardless of whether the CMM uses IMSI-range-based UUT or            subscribed UUT.</p><p>The Décor service applies only for a UE in its home PLMN, shared PLMN, or            treat-as-home subscriber PLMN.</p></conbody></concept>
