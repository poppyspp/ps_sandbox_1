There are also some S-GW geo-redundancy switchover            scenarios, involving network issues, that result in the relocation of the UEs to a            completely different S-GW pair, using the same TEID, before the old pair completes the            switchover. Then, when the old pair completes its switchover, the newly active S-GW half            of the old pair sends DDNs to the MME for those UEs, even though it has been long since            those UEs were relocated to another S-GW pair. In such scenarios, the old S-GW sends the            correct TEID to the MME in the DDN from the wrong S-GW. Without this feature, the MME            ignores those DDNs and does not respond with a DDN Acknowledge message. This results in            stuck UEs on the old S-GW pair and requires manual intervention by the operator to clean            up before any pages can succeed for those UEs.</p><p>With this feature, when the MME gets a DDN with cause value 254, and if the TEID is            recognized but the DDN is from the wrong S-GW, the MME responds with a DDN Acknowledge            message with a TEID of 0, with the same sequence number as it is in the DDN, and with a            cause value of 64 Context not found, back to the sending (wrong) S-GW. In this case, the            S-GW knows to clean up automatically.</p></conbody></concept>
