This IPPS is            excluded from the selection rule when a new PDP is established.</p><p>After the IPPS recovery is done, if a downlink packet is received, the subscriber            is paged in order to re-establish the RAB that was released due to the IPPS restart.</p><p>When the IPPS receives an error indication, the IPPS understands which PAPS is serving a            PDP based on the endpoint IP and TEID. So the IPPS sends the error indication to the            appropriate serving PAPS VM for the necessary handling, instead of broadcasting that to            all the PAPS VMs.</p><p>This feature can also resolve the IPPS restarts when enabling GTP user plane            echoes.</p></conbody></concept>
