The SUPIs are different for different SIM cards. This feature can be controlled with        global parameter <parmname>multiSimWithSameMsisdnSupport</parmname>. By default, this        feature is disabled.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>This feature supports up to five UEs to share the same MSISDN. These changes affect the            lawful interception, call trace and event exposure functions as follows:</p><ul><li>The LI targets are selected based on multiple UE entries that are using the same                MSISDN. In addition, all the UE entries are treated as LI targets, if the MSISDN is                in the LI target list.</li><li>The AMF performs call traces on all UEs that the CT job is keyed by the MSISDN and                there are multiple UEs/SUPIs mapped to the MSISDN. </li><li>The AMF rejects Event Exposure requests if the request has only the MSISDN without                the IMSI.</li></ul></conbody></concept>
