The certificate management        protocol (CMP) is an internal protocol standardized by the IETF used for obtaining X.509        digital certificates in a public key infrastructure (PKI).</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>In a public key infrastructure (PKI), the end entities (EEs) act as the CMP            client, and request the certificate for themselves from a certificate authority (CA).            The CA issues the TLS certificates and acts as a CMP server (for example, the PKI            server). The CMM is always the CMP client.</p><p>The CMP client can utilize the CMP to obtain the TLS certificates from a CA,            request TLS certificates updates, and get the TLS certificates revoked. The use of the            CMP replaces the <cmdname>scp</cmdname> and <cmdname>sftp</cmdname> commands used to            copy the TLS certificate files and certificate revocation list files to the NECC            disk.</p><p>The following CMPv2 operations are supported:</p><ul><li>Initial registration (IR): The CMM obtains a certificate from a certain CA for the                first time.</li><li>Certificate update (CR): The CMM obtains additional certificates from the CA.</li><li>Key pair update (KUR): The CMM updates an existing TLS certificate for any reason,                such as a key or certificate refresh before the key or certificate expires.</li><li>Certificate revocation list (CRL): The CMM obtains certificate revocation list (CRL)                from the CA.</li><li>Polling: In some cases, the CA may not immediately return the certificate. The CMM                supports polling requests and responds. Polling is used for the IR, CR and KUR                operations. The CMM raises a critical alarm when a CMPv2 operation fails due to a                polling failure. The alarm is deleted when the next CMPv2 operation with the CA                succeeds.</li></ul><p>The CMM only requests one certificate in each IR, CR and KUR message.</p><p>The CMP provides inbuilt integrity protection and authentication.</p></conbody></concept>
