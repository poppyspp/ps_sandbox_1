The root certificate authority (CA),            intermediate CA certificates, and the certificates and the private keys can be            configured and selected to be applied to the links via the associated to the link TLS            profile.</p><p>The MME TLS feature is intended for use on MME-only or QA MME-AMF            configurations. IPsec cannot be used on the SGSN and the TLS on the MME on QA/TA            configurations at the same time, and the <cmdname>liconf</cmdname>            command blocks such configuration on X1_1 and X2 interfaces.</p><p>For detailed configuring instructions, see <cite>Configuring TLS for the MME</cite>.</p></conbody></concept>
