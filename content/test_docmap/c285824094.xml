The trigger for        starting suppression of the MME paging was three consecutive failed procedures due to an        inability to reach a UE with paging. With this feature, the number of consecutive failed        procedures needed to trigger suppression of the MME paging can be modified using the new        global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname>.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>The global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname> can be modified to adjust the criteria for            triggering the automatic suppression of the MME paging. The default value is                <option>3</option>. The value ranges from 1 to 5. In general, the paging gap            functionality is triggered more often by an MME when this global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname> is set to a lower value. When            this global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname> is            set to a higher value, the paging gap functionality is triggered less often.</p><p>For example, if the global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname> is set to <option>2</option>, then the            suppression of the MME paging is triggered after two or more consecutive MME call            processing procedures have failed because the UE cannot be reached. Similarly, if the            global parameter <parmname>pagingGapFailCountTrigger</parmname> is set            to 5, then the suppression of the MME paging is triggered after five or more consecutive            MME call processing procedures have failed because the UE cannot be reached.</p></conbody></concept>
