With this        feature, an operator can deploy option-3/3a/3x/5G overlay networks with a dedicated pool of        the DCNR capable GW.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>This feature affects the DNS queries made during Release 7 and Release 8 PDP            context activation. The subscriber network capability for the DCNR is indicated by the            corresponding flag of the MS network capability IE in the attach/RAU messages in both            2G/3G scenarios. All basic MM/SM scenarios are executed successfully with the selection            of the DCNR-capable GW if applicable.</p><section>            <title>Rel-7 DNS</title>            <p>In case of a Rel-7 DNS query, if the MS is DCNR-capable, the SGSN                includes the tag "5GC" in the modified APN field as shown in the example below. If                the DNS query fails, the PDP activation will be rejected.</p>            <p><option>internet.5GC.mnc123.mcc123.gprs</option></p>            <p>This applies also when other intelligent GGSN/GW selection features                are present. The 5GC tag is included along with the tags from other features. For                example, when the features for IMSI-based selection, nearest GGSN, and GGSN                selection based on charging characteristics are enabled along with this feature, the                tag is included as below:</p>            <p><option>internet.5GC.IMSI-TAG.RNC-ID-TAG.CC-TAG.mnc123.mcc123.gprs</option></p>        </section><section>            <title>Rel-8 DNS</title>            <p>In case of Rel-8 DNS query, if the MS is DCNR-capable, the SGSN appends the “+nc-nr”                string at the service parameters included at the APN FQDN for the P-GWs and the RAI                FQDN for the S-GWs as below:</p>            <ul><li><option>x-3gpp-pgw:x-s5-gtp+nc-nr</option></li><li><option>x-3gpp-sgw:x-s4+nc-nr</option></li></ul>        </section><section>            <title>HSS's DCNR access restriction</title>            <p>When this feature is enabled and the CMM interacts with the HSS                (S4-SGSN), the CMM indicates the “NR as Secondary RAT” in Feature-List-2 AVP in                corresponding ULR/IDA messages to the HSS. The HSS can also indicate the support of                “NR as Secondary RAT” in Feature-List-2 AVP in corresponding IDR/ULA messages.</p>            <p>The HSS indicates DCNR access restriction as part of the subscription                data when the CMM has indicated that it supports the DCNR feature. Thus, it is                possible for the HSS to update the DCNR restriction via the Insert Subscriber Data                Request message. The CMM receives and considers this information before sending the                DNS query.</p>            <p>If the HSS indicates the support of “NR as Secondary RAT”, the CMM                checks the state of “NR as Secondary RAT: Not Allowed” bit in the Access Restriction                Data AVP. If there is no restriction, the Rel-8 DNS query is made with the new DCNR                capability (NAPTR with modified services "+nc-nr"). Otherwise, pre-existing logic is                followed, that is, NAPTR without modified services "+nc-nr".</p>            <p>In case that the HSS does not indicate the support of “NR as                Secondary RAT”, the CMM ignores the state of “NR as Secondary RAT: Not Allowed” in                the Access Restriction Data AVP and assume that the DCNR is allowed for the UE                proceeding with Rel-8 DNS query with the new DCNR capability (NAPTR with modified                services "+nc-nr").</p>        </section></conbody></concept>
