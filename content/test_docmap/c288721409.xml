This UUT overrides any UUT that has been provided by the HSS.            New flags are added to define whether the 5G subscription data and/or 5G NAS capable are            used for UUT override. The use case for this feature is a network overlay. The operator            wants the new MME to be able to register and provide service to 5G-capable UEs, which            currently trying to access the 4G network since they are out of 5G coverage, while            reassigning legacy UEs to an underlay MME network. The DÃ©cor reroute moves the legacy            UEs to the underlay, with the UUT being assigned through local provisioning at the            overlay MME. The network is set up that the RAN initially directs unknown UEs to the            overlay MME.</p></conbody></concept>
