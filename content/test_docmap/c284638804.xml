The        authentication support allows the NTP client to verify that the NTP server is trusted. </shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>The NTP client authenticates the packets of NTP server with symmetric keys. </p><p>The network time security (NTS) for the NTP is a new authentication mechanism            specified by the IETF for the NTP. It allows the clients to verify that the packets they            received from the server are not modified while transiting.</p><p>The NTS includes a key establishment (NTS-KE) protocol that automatically creates            the encryption keys used between the server and its clients. The NTS uses the TLS on TCP            port 4460 to establish the keys. The NTS provides the clients with cookies, which are            encrypted and contain the keys needed to authenticate the NTP packets. The NTP packets            are authenticated with authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).</p></conbody></concept>
