Association events include both allocation or deallocation events for            temporary identifiers managed by the AMF and for identifier association which are            registered or de-registered in the AMF. The IEF supports the activation and deactivation            of association reporting capabilities over the LI_XEM1. The controller used is the LICF            proxied by the LIPF.</p><p>Upon the activation of the IEF function, the AMF generates report records when the            following events have been detected for any UE:</p><ul><li>The association of a 5G-GUTI to a SUPI. This involves detection of the Registration                Accept message or the Configuration Update message sent by the AMF towards the UE. </li><li>The scenario of an initial unsuccessful 5G-GUTI assignment leading AMF to eventually                assign a new 5G-GUTI. </li><li>The de-association of a 5G-GUTI from a SUPI. This involves detection of                De-registration Accept message in case of UE de-registration, De-registration                Request message in case of network de-registering the UE, inter-AMF handover or                I-RAT handover.</li></ul><p>The IEF association record includes at least the following information:</p><p>The SUPI associated with the detected event, the 5G-GUTI, the time at which the            identifier association event occurred, the last known TAI associated with the SUPI, the            last known nCGI(s) available when identifier association event was detected, and the UE            location timestamps of the nCGI(s) if available in the AMF.</p><p>The IEF de-association record includes at least the following information:</p><p>The SUPI associated with the detected de-association event, the 5G-GUTI, the time at            which the identifier de-association event occurred, the last known nCGI(s) when            identifier de-association event is detected, the UE location timestamps of the nCGI(s)            if available in the AMF.</p><p>Both connections towards the LICF (ADMF) over the LI_XEM1 interface and towards the ICF            over the LI_XER interface support the TLS encryption. </p><p>The activation of the IEF functionality in the AMF involves two steps. In the first step,            the operator needs to enable the <parmname>iefAct</parmname> parameter when issuing the                <cmdname>liconf amfAdmf create</cmdname> command during provisioning. In the second            step, the ADMF should request the activation of the IEF association reporting            capabilities by sending an Activate Task Request message over the LI_XEM1 interface that            includes a target identifier of type identity association. At this point, the IEF            function is considered as enabled and identity association reporting over the LI_XER is            expected.</p><p>Upon receiving a valid Deactivate Task Request message over the LI_XEM1 interface, the            IEF stops generating records. With this feature, both the LI_X1 and LI_XEM1 interfaces            for both the POI &amp; IEF functions are supported at the same time. In addition, there            are two distinct links between the AMF and MDF2, and the IEF and ICF for supporting both            the POI and IEF functions.</p></conbody></concept>
