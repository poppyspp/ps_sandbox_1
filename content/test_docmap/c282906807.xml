The                    <cmdname>multipleHomePlmnName</cmdname> can be other network, serving network or                home network (as long as it is a different PLMN name than the                    <parmname>servedPlmnName</parmname>).</li><li>The MME communicates with the rest of the NFs, for example, the HSS, the S-GW                and the P-GW, uses the home/serving PLMN ID for the queries or the messages.                However, the IMSI of the multiple-home PLMN ID is always used.</li><li>The RAN nodes are configured only with the home PLMN ID, and the RAN only                broadcasts the home PLMN ID. The MME does not include the multiple-home PLMN IDs in                the setup messages.</li></ul></conbody></concept>
