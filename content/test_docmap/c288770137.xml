When this feature is activated, and there is an ongoing CMAS broadcast towards the            targeted gNBs, the AMF queues up to 20 WEA messages and holds those queued messages for            a provisioned time. Once the CMAS broadcast towards the targeted gNBs completes, the AMF            processes the next WEA message in the queue. This processing continues until there is no            more WEA message in the queue. If the provisioned hold time of a queued WEA message            expires, it will be removed from the queue.</p><p>The CBCF vendors need to support delayed HTTP/2 responses from the AMF as a result of the            AMF queuing WEA message requests where the TCP connection needs to be maintained by the            CBCF. An example of maintaining the TCP connection is for the CBCF to initiate ping            frames to keep the TCP connection alive. If the TCP connection is not maintained by the            CBCF, the AMF is not able to send a HTTP/2 response to the CBCF once it dequeues the WEA            message requests and processes it.</p></conbody></concept>
