The alarm sustained            interval has a range from 0 to 120 minutes, with a default value of 0 minute. When the            unbound round trip timeout (RTO) exceeds the critical threshold, the alarm is only            raised when the critical threshold remains exceeded for the entire alarm sustained            interval. When the default interval (0 minute) is set, this feature is disabled, and the            raising of the alarm is unchanged. The conditions to clear the alarm remain unchanged by            this feature.</p></conbody></concept>
