The ADMF can resend the            targets to the CMM.</p><note>This feature does not automatically inform the ADMF (LIC) about purging all            the targets in the CMM. Thus, the operator take follow-up actions to reset the target            lists again after this purge function has been performed. Otherwise, the LI function            will not work. </note></conbody></concept>
