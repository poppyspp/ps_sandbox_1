This feature also modifies PCF handling and supports UE policy association for        non-3GPP access.</shortdesc><prolog><author>PEIPEI SHANG</author></prolog><conbody><p>The AMF supports:</p><ul><li>PDU-related network-triggered interactions when a UE is registered over both                3GPP and non-3GPP access.</li><li>Paging via 3GPP access when the UE is in CM-IDLE state over non-3GPP                access.</li><li>Service request over non-3GPP access.</li><li>NAS notification over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses when the UE is in CM-IDLE                state over the triggering access.</li></ul><p>This feature supports the following procedures:</p><ul><li>UE-triggered service request for non-3GPP access for signaling connection and                data activation.</li><li>Network-triggered service request for non-3GPP access. Notification or paging                depending on the RM/CM states. NAS notification is a new procedure for a UE                registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP access, and it is used instead of paging when                there is a network (SMF) trigger (N1N2MessageTransfer) for one access in which the                UE is in CM-IDLE state while the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state on other access. In                that case, a downlink NAS message containing the NAS notification is sent on behalf                of the idle access, on the connected access. The notification procedure can serve                both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. Note that paging over non-3GPP access is not                supported.</li><li>PDU switching in registration procedure/service request to the 3GPP access as                response to paging/notification for non-3GPP access. For example, when the SMF sends                trigger for a PDU last routed over non-3GPP access, but the UE is currently outside                of the non-3GPP access coverage, thus, the PDU can be switched to 3GPP access, if                allowed by the UE policy.</li><li>PCF selection, AM/UE policy association for non-3GPP access. For the UE that is                already registered in an AMF (on whatever access, 3GPP or non-3GPP) with existing                PCF association (AM/UE), the AMF does not create/update the PCF association for the                new access type.</li></ul></conbody></concept>
